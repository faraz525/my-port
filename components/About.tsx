            Hi! üëã My name is Faraz Qureshi and I am a social entrepreneur looking to use my skills in 
            problem solving, computer programming üíª, and leadership to help make a global üåé impact. 
            I have been tinkering with and creating since freshman year of high school through robotics 
            and a non-profit I formed to fight the stigma against students with special needs. Now, I have 
            been able to refine my programming knowledge through SWE internships and have been working on my 
            company cledge - looking to democratize the college advising space - for the past year. Scroll 
            down to learn more about my journey üõ§Ô∏è and contact me!
